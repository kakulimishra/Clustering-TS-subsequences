###The original data cleaning of theeee London dataset in done in the graph based clustering work. 
##But after analysing the data, I found that some of the  buildings have all zero readings, which was the cause of poor results
##in the anomaly detection part of graph based clustering work. Hence, in this work, I have removed the houses which have continuus readings
